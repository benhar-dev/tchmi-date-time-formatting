## Overview 
This is a simple example to show how to use a custom function to format the date and time received from the server variable.  

![Example](docs/png/example.png)

In order to see the server symbols you must enable advanced view in TcHmi Configuration, which can be done by clicking the three dots on the top bar.

### Intl.DateTimeFormat
This code uses the Intl.DateTimeFormat found here...

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat

### Javascript
```
function CustomDateTimeFormat(DateTimeString) {

                // example of a substitute date time format when TcHmi.Localization.formatDate(date) is not possible.

                var date = new Date(DateTimeString);

                var options = {
                    year: 'numeric', month: 'numeric', day: 'numeric',
                    hour: 'numeric', minute: 'numeric', second: 'numeric',
                    hour12: true,
                };

                return (new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-GB', options).format(date));

            }
```
